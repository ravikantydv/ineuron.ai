"Investment Predicton"

This repository represents machine learning technique to identify market changes earlier than possible with traditional investment models.
With the help of this project we can detect the Investment Predictions process and can automate it using machine learning and deep learning.


 ## Description

This implemantation is based on Machine learning and Deep learning techniques.
In this project I have used LSTM MODEL of deep learning and random forest, decision tree , Linear Regression etc.. for Prediction Purposes.
